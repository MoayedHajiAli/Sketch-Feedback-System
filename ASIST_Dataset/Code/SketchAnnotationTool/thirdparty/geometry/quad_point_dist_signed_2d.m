%% QUAD_POINT_DIST_SIGNED_2D: signed distanct ( quadrilateral, point ) in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The quadrilateral must be convex.  DIST_SIGNED is actually the maximum 
%    of the signed distances from the point to each of the four lines that 
%    make up the quadrilateral.
%
%    Essentially, if the point is outside the convex quadrilateral,
%    only one of the signed distances can be positive, or two can
%    be positive and equal.

%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, real Q(2,4), the vertices of the quadrilateral.
%
%    Input, real P(2), the point which is to be checked.
%
%    Output, real DIST_SIGNED, the signed distance from the 
%    point to the convex quadrilateral.  If DIST_SIGNED is
%    0.0, the point is on the boundary;
%    negative, the point is in the interior;
%    positive, the point is in the exterior.
%
  dim_num = 2;
%
%  Compare the signed distance from each line segment to the point,
%  with the signed distance to the midpoint of the opposite line.
%
%  The signed distances should all be negative if the point is inside.
