%% STRI_CONTAINS_POINT determines if a spherical triangle contains a point.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    A sphere centered at 0 in 3D satisfies the equation:
%
%      X*X + Y*Y + Z*Z = R*R
%
%    A spherical triangle is specified by three points on the surface
%    of the sphere.  The inside of the triangle is defined by the fact
%    that the three points are listed in counterclockwise order. 
%    Here "counterclockwise" is with reference to an observer standing
%    outside the sphere.
%
%    If P is a point on the sphere, we say that the spherical triangle
%    "contains" P if P is in the interior of the spherical triangle.
%    We do not actually require that P be a point on the sphere.  Instead,
%    we consider the ray defined from the origin through P, which intersects
%    the sphere.  It is essentially this point of intersection we are
%    considering.

%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, real V1(3), V2(3), V3(3), the vertices of the triangle.
%
%    Input, real P(3), a point on the sphere, or the point on
%    the sphere determined by the ray from the origin through P.  P must
%    not be zero.
%
%    Output, real CONTAINS, is positive if the spherical triangle
%    contains P, zero if P is exactly on the boundary of the triangle, and
%    negative if P is outside the triangle.
