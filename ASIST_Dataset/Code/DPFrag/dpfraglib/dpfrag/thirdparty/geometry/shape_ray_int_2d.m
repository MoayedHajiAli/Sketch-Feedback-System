%% SHAPE_RAY_INT_2D: intersection ( regular shape, ray ) in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The "regular shape" is assumed to be an equilateral and equiangular
%    polygon, such as the standard square, pentagon, hexagon, and so on.
%
%    The origin of the ray is assumed to be inside the shape.  This
%    guarantees that the ray will intersect the shape in exactly one point.

%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, real CENTER(2), the center of the shape.
%
%    Input, real P1(2), the first vertex of the shape.
%
%    Input, integer NSIDE, the number of sides in the shape.
%
%    Input, real PA(2), the origin of the ray.
%
%    Input, real PB(2), a second point on the ray.
%
%    Output, real PI(2), the point on the shape intersected
%    by the ray.

%
%  Warning!
%  No check is made to ensure that the ray origin is inside the shape.
%  These calculations are not valid if that is not true!
%
%  Determine the angle subtended by a single side.

%  and see if that angle contains the ray.  If so, then the ray
%  must intersect the shape side of that sector.

%  segment intersect, so we can use the simpler code that treats them
