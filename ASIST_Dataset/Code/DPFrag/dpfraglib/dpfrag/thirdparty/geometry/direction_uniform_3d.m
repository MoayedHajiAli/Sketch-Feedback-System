%
%  Pick a uniformly random VDOT, which must be between -1 and 1.
%  This represents the dot product of the random vector with the Z unit vector.
%
%  Note: this works because the surface area of the sphere between
%  Z and Z + dZ is independent of Z.  So choosing Z uniformly chooses
%  a patch of area uniformly.

%  Pick a uniformly random rotation between 0 and 2 Pi around the
%  axis of the Z vector.
